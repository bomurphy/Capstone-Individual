I have created a webpage that using HTML and PHP that uses a login system that protects a page containing
a table with information about my favorite food that I created using MYSQL. The page takes a username and password and if the username and password are correct, then the HTML page will take you to the PHP page where the favorite food table will be displayed. Passwords are also encrypted so they are not readable in the database.
