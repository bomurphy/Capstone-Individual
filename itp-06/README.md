For ITP 06, I have created a web page that adds registration functionality to my pages funbtionaitly for ITP 05. The registration includes email, first name, last name, and password. The password must be entered twice during registration and the both passwords must match. Also, passwords must be over 8 characters. Once a user is registered they should be able to login to the login page using their email and password. Once they input they're email and password they will be directed to the index page where the food table will appear.
